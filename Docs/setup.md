INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP GITPOD


## GitPod

GitPod provides effimeral workspaces for software development.
It is similar to GitHub's CodeSpaces, but GitPod works with GitHub,
GitLab, and Bitbucket and is not owned by GitHub/Microsoft.

GitPod provides its users with 50 free computing hours per month.

We will use it because it will provide all participants with a consistent
development environment, pre-installed with PLCC and the workshop materials.
